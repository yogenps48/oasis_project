            <p>Avul Pakir Jainulabdeen Abdul Kalam was an Indian aerospace scientist and statesman
                who served as the 11th president of India from 2002 to 2007. He was born and raised
                in Rameswaram, Tamil Nadu and studied physics and aerospace engineering. He spent
                the next four decades as a scientist and science administrator, mainly at the Defence
                Research and Development Organisation (DRDO) and Indian Space Research Organisation
                (ISRO) and was intimately involved in India's civilian space programme and military
                missile development efforts.[1] He thus came to be known as the Missile Man of India
                for his work on the development of ballistic missile and launch vehicle technology
